# Shop
I developed a shop management system where users can register with their details, securely stored in a database. The login functionality ensures authentication by verifying user details against the database. As an administrator, I implemented a feature to view and manage the user list, providing the ability to delete users if necessary. Additionally, the admin section allows for seamless product management, facilitating the addition of new products to the shop. This project showcases my proficiency in user authentication, database management, and admin functionalities for effective shopÂ administration.
